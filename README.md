# Library_Project
This project implements a simple movie library using a linked list structure.
It allows users to add, remove, search, and filter movies, as well as read from and write to a file.

## Features
- Add movies
- Remove movies
- Search for movies
- Filter movies by attributes
- Display all movies
- Import/export movie data to/from a file
## GOAL
- My Goal is to work more on back-end methods for storing huge amounts of data and displaying only the needed or requested entities.
